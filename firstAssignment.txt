1. There is a redundent key, because the customerId could used as a key because it is unique for every costumer.
    In adittion, In my opinion the name of the costumer should be stored in different table next to his matching id.  
    Also, There is no need for purchesses, instead a new tbale for items should be created with id of items and his name.
2.  Insertion anomaly - when inserting new purchese.
		       For example, the new purchase could be with the same id but with different name.
3. CREATE TABLE PURCHASES (customerId INTEGER, purchase_id INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY (costumerId, purchase_id)
    CREATE TABLE COSTUMERS (PRIMARY KEY customerId INTEGER,COSTUMER name TEXT NOT NULL);
    CREATE TABLE ITEMS (PRIMARY KEY ID INTEGER, name TEXT NOT NULL);
4. PURCHESSES is a MULTY VALUE ATTRIBUTE, and no need for id in original table.
